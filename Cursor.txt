How Does the Cursor function?

The functionality of the cursor can vary depending on the game. Most 3rd Person games don't always have a fixed position for the cursor whereas 1st person games usually have it in the center of the screen by default or as a fixed position. Some genres may not require cursors at all such as RPGs or platformers (with the possible exception of menus). The cursor can be used to interact with objects in the game world. Some games may function entirely around the cursor such as a Tic Tac Toe game for example where it is how players place the Xs and Os in each square. Such a game is usually described as a "Point-And-Click" game. A notable example of a game that uses the cursor effectively is Super Mario Galaxy. In that game, the cursor can be used for multiple differnt purposes such as shooting stars, blowing bubbles, pulling objects in various directions, aiming cannons and many more. That particular example has the cursor controlled through the use of motion controls which is a potential option for cursor control provided the system you are developing for supports motion controls to begin with. In shooter games, the cursor usually acts as a reticle to indicate where players will shoot, making it easier aim. Cursors can also be used to gather information on the environment around you. Sometimes when hovering the cursor over a notable object in the game, the game may display a name as well as other information about whatever players are hovering over.
